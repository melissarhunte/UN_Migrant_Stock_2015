# Tidying the United Nations Trends in International Migrant Stock (2015) data

The United Nations accumulated 25 years of data on international migration and refugee patterns from 1990 to 2015 (UN, 2015c).The United Nations Trends in International Migrant Stock (2015) data comprised six data tables in six separate separate excel sheets. The data were collected between 1990 -2015 and were organized by location, country code, and gender. In summary, the six tables represented the total word’s population, percentage migrants in the total population, total migrant population, percentage female migrants in the total migrant population, percentage refugees in the total migrant population, and the annual rate of change of the migrant and refugee population.

These data were tidied based on Wickham’s (2014) Tidy Data principles. Tidying resulted in two separate data sets, one with all the population, migration, and refugee trends by year and location, and another with the annual rate of change in migration and refugee patterns by period and location. Both datasets were used in these analyses.
